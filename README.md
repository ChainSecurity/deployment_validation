# DVF - Deployment Validation Files

Deployment Validation allows to ensure the intended code was deployed with a correct configuration. DVFs are supposed to be an open standard to enable decentralized and efficient deployment validation. This is under active development.

To learn more you can:

* Read the [technical specification](./spec.md)
* Read some example use cases:
  * [Creating a DVF for a simple contract](./simple.md)
  * [Creating a DVF for a proxy contract](./proxy.md)
  * [Ensuring Distributed Ownership](./ownership.md)
  * [Updating an existing DVF](./update.md)

We are about to start a private alpha test to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in being a tester, please sign up [here](https://forms.office.com/e/xPPwfRymnJ).
